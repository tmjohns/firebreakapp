# Introduction

Firebreak App is in the early stages of development. 
With the launch of Open Banking account and transaction APIs from November 2020, we are about to reach the point where launching our beta is feasible. We are ready to scale our development and deployment and commence the next phase of our journey. 


## Roadmap

Firebreak is a lean startup. We are iteratively building our app as Open Banking evolves. 

The key features planned for our intial release are -

* Import account/transaction data from all data providers in Australia.
* On device transaction classification.
* Ability for customer to view full financial position across assets, investments, expenses and liabilities.
* Ability to allocate funds to budgets, set goals and track performance. 

Key milestones we expect to meet are -

Date | Milestone
-----|-----
Early 2021 | Launch Public Beta with opt-in consumers from the 4 major banks (who are going live with account and transaction data by then).
Mid-2021 | Extend the Beta to consumers of the second tier banks as they come online with open banking.
1 July 2021 | Open Banking Accreditation complete and Firebreak App generally available on the App Store and Google Play. 

We'll do fortnightly feature releases from there. 

Additional features to be prioritised in consultation with our customers include -
* Bank Account Comparisons.
* Initiate Applications.
* Payment Services via the National Payments Platform.
* Web/Desktop avilability.
* Day 1 availability for Consumer Data Right phases for Energy and Telecommunications.

# Strategic Analysis

Open banking represents a unique strategic opportunity. The new regulations have been created to provide opportunities for new entrants to enter the market. This is a significant disruption to the market.

The biggest challenge posed to start up businesses in this space is the guardrails which have been placed around the participants. The process to gain accreditation as a data recipient requires significant work. This will preserve consumer security and privacy, but may prevent some new entrants. 

The incumbent providers have already been required to make significant investment in developing the Open Banking API's. They must now consider how to operate in an environment with open data. Consumers will have more information to choose providers to do business with, and will less sticky as their data is not tied to one provider. 

Firebreak App's key differentiators as we enter the market will be -

* Our commitment to consumer privacy.
* Our artificial intelligence capability.


## Current State

### PESTLE Analysis
The PESTLE framework allows for an impact analysis across 6 key domains. 

Domain | Impact
-----|-----
Political | In various forms, Open Banking has been on the political agenda in many jurisdictions across the world. The UK and EU have both adopted similar positions, and the 'Consumer Data Right' is the implementation adopted in Australia. 
Economic | The Australian Government has required that the major banks adopt open banking, producing APIs that will allow the access we need to succeed. They are expecting significant economic growth to come from the new opportunities enabled by the Consumer Data Right. 
Social | Currently, there are very few implementations of Open Banking / Consumer Data Right technology that have direct impact on the consumer. As such, the typical consumer is not yet aware of what these changes mean to them. As a practical implementation that offers a direct benefit, Firebreak App can pitch itself as being linked with this technology as it gains social acceptance. Consumers are also increasingly aware of the social impacts of the technology they use, and are becoming significantly more privacy conscious.
Legal | There are significant legal guidelines being put in place to safeguard access to data made available via Consumer Data Right. To become an accredited recipient, Firebreak App will need to complete this acceditation process. 
Technological | The smartphone has become the primary device for many people to use for managing their lives. People are accustomed to doing shopping, managing finances, paying bills etc. via their smart phones. Currently, each of these activities requires a specific, separate app, tied to the provider of their choice. Firebreak App aims to offer a platform that allows for these activities to be peformed via the same app, to allow consumers to easily manage their finances. 
Environmental | Consumers are increasingly aware of the environmental impact of their choices. Ethical and sustaibility issues are becoming key drivers of purchasing decisions.

* Enterprise focused.
* Offers white label service for potential app vendors - this is an option for Firebreak. We need to do our due dilligence and determine if we can achieve our security and privacy objectives if we utilize this service. In scope for our MVP while we secure our own accredititation. 

* Has own app offering that pre-dates open banking.

* DevOps (2-4 people)- to establish quality development and operational practices and support a regular release cadence. 
* IT Architect (1-2 people) - to provide leadership and set the direction for the underlying technologies we use.
* Security Engineer (1-2 people) - to ensure we exceed the rigorous security standards we set for ourselves.
* Marketing, HR, Corporate Governance functions to support a team of between 30 and 40 people.
