# Strategic Analysis

Open banking represents a unique strategic opportunity. The new regulations have been created to provide opportunities for new entrants to enter the market. This is a significant disruption to the market.

The biggest challenge posed to start up businesses in this space is the guardrails which have been placed around the participants. The process to gain accreditation as a data recipient requires significant work. This will preserve consumer security and privacy, but may prevent some new entrants. 

The incumbents have already been required to make significant investment in developing the Open Banking API's. They must now consider how to operate in an environment with open data. 

Firebreak App's key differentiators as we enter the market will be -

* Our commitment to consumer privacy.
* Our artificial intelligence capability.
