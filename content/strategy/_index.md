# Introduction

Firebreak App is in the early stages of development. 
With the launch of Open Banking account and transaction APIs from November 2020, we are about to reach the point where launching our beta is feasible. We are ready to scale our development and deployment and commence the next phase of our journey. 


## Roadmap

Firebreak is a lean startup. We are iteratively building our app as Open Banking evolves. 

The key features planned for our intial release are -

* Import account/transaction data from all data providers in Australia.
* On device transaction classification.
* Ability for customer to view full financial position across assets, investments, expenses and liabilities.
* Ability to allocate funds to budgets, set goals and track performance. 

Key milestones we expect to meet are -

Date | Milestone
-----|-----
Early 2021 | Launch Public Beta with opt-in consumers from the 4 major banks (who are going live with account and transaction data by then).
Mid-2021 | Extend the Beta to consumers of the second tier banks as they come online with open banking.
1 July 2021 | Open Banking Accreditation complete and Firebreak App generally available on the App Store and Google Play. 

We'll do fortnightly feature releases from there. 

Additional features to be prioritised in consultation with our customers include -
* Bank Account Comparisons.
* Initiate Applications.
* Payment Services via the National Payments Platform.
* Web/Desktop avilability.
* Day 1 availability for Consumer Data Right phases for Energy and Telecommunications.

# Strategic Analysis

Open banking represents a unique strategic opportunity. The new regulations have been created to provide opportunities for new entrants to enter the market. This is a significant disruption to the market.

The biggest challenge posed to start up businesses in this space is the guardrails which have been placed around the participants. The process to gain accreditation as a data recipient requires significant work. This will preserve consumer security and privacy, but may prevent some new entrants. 

The incumbent providers have already been required to make significant investment in developing the Open Banking API's. They must now consider how to operate in an environment with open data. Consumers will have more information to choose providers to do business with, and will less sticky as their data is not tied to one provider. 

Firebreak App's key differentiators as we enter the market will be -

* Our commitment to consumer privacy.
* Our artificial intelligence capability.

### Competitor Analysis

[Frollo](https://frollo.com.au)

* The only non-bank accredited Consumer Data Right data recipient. 

* Enterprise focused. Primary market is access to the APIs. 

* They offer a white label service for app developers, providing access to the APIs.

*This is an option for Firebreak. We need to do our due dilligence and determine if we can achieve our security and privacy objectives if we utilize this service. It is under consideration as we build our MVP while we secure our own accredititation.*
 
* They also have their own consumer app offering that pre-dates open banking (using manual uploads / data scraping etc.). This app has some traction in the market, but there is scope for multiple platforms, and our commitment to consumer privacy will set us apart.
