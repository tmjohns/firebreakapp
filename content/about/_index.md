Firebreak is a new business formed by a team of people committed to helping people make good financial decisions through easy to use technology. We were dissatisfied with the limitations of the technology offered by the major banks. 

Our App is our vision of what things should be. 
<br> We believe that: 

* **Technology should enable people.**

* **People should own their data.**

* **Data allows for better decisions.**

Firebreak App is new money management app, enabled by artificial intelligence and open banking. 

FIRE is an acronym for an emerging philosophy of money management - ‘Financial Independence and Retire Early’. The aim is to control spending and maximise the value of every dollar on the way to generating wealth and independence. 

**Our app helps you take this level of control over your money.**

Break away from the limitations of your bank and their mobile app. Choose the accounts that work for you, even if they’re with different banks. Bring all the data into Firebreak. Track your spending. Set goals, and measure progress toward them. 

**Our app helps you achieve your goals.** 

A firebreak is a buffer zone of cleared land used to control the spread of wildfire and protect valuable assets. 
 
**Firebreak app helps you build a buffer around your finances, protecting yourself.** 

 Understanding, analysis, smart budgeting and goal-setting are all enabled by the quality information straight from your chosen provider.

Open Banking is the first phase of the Australian 'Consumer Data Right'. Providers of banking services are required to build interfaces that allow other parties to securely access data. This includes information about the products and services they offer. With customer consent, it also includes access to account and transaction information. (Treasury, 2018)

This video from the Australian Consumer and Competition Comission (ACCC, 2020b) explains more -

Firebreak App will be an accredited recipient of information under the 'Consumer Data Right' (ACCC, 2020). This will allow our app to make secure connections on your behalf and download all the information from your providers. From there, your data will live on your device for you to manage and analyse as you need. We'll make it as easy as we can. Our artificial-intelligence enabled classification engine will sort your transactions for you, helping you to understand where your money goes and set appropriate budgets and goals. 

Future phases of the 'Consumer Data Right' will allow similar access to information from telecommunications and energy providers (ACCC, 2018). Firebreak App will be there too. You'll have access to all of your data, and be able to compare offers from providers that suit your needs. It will be easy to choose the provider that best suits your needs.

Firebreak App will be generally available as more providers come online. If you're with a provider that is already on-line with Open Banking (such as the major Australian banks), reach out to join our public beta and help us build Firebreak together.
