Firebreak App is a one stop shop for managing your finances. A firebreak is a buffer zone that stops the spread of disasterous wildfire. Our app helps you build a firebreak for your finances. Understanding, management, smart budgeting and goal-setting are all enabled by quality information. You will finally have enough information to achieve FIRE - financial independence and early retirement. 

Open Banking is the first phase of the Australian 'Consumer Data Right'. Providers of banking services are required to build interfaces that allow other parties to securely access data. This includes information about the products and services they offer. With customer consent, it also includes access to account and transaction information. (Treasury, 2018)

Firebreak App will be an accredited recipient of information under the 'Consumer Data Right' (ACCC, 2020). This will allow our app to make secure connections on your behalf and download all the information from your providers. From there, your data will live on your device for you to manage and analyse as you need. We'll make it as easy as we can. Our artificial-intelligence enabled classification engine will sort your transactions for you, helping you to understand where your money goes and set appropriate budgets and goals. 

Future phases of the 'Consumer Data Right' will allow similar access to information from telecommunications and energy providers (ACCC, 2018). Firebreak App will be there too. You'll have access to all of your data, and be able to compare offers from providers that suit your needs.

Firebreak App is a new business formed by a team of people committed to helping people get ahead financially. We were dissatisfied with the limitations of the technology offered by the major banks. Our App is our vision of what things should be.

Firebreak App will be generally available as more providers come online. If you're with a provider that is already on-line with Open Banking (such as the major Australian banks), reach out to join our public beta and help us build Firebreak together.
