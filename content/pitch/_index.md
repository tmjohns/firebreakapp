 ## What?

A money management app, enabled by artificial intelligence and open banking. 

 ## Why Firebreak?

FIRE is an acronym for an emerging philosophy of money management - ‘Financial Independence and Retire Early’. The aim is to control spending and maximise the value of every dollar on the way to generating wealth and independence. 

**Our app helps you take this level of control over your money.**

Break away from the limitations of your bank and their mobile app. Choose the accounts that work for you, even if they’re with different banks. Bring all the data into Firebreak. Track your spending. Set goals, and measure progress toward them. 

**Our app helps you achieve your goals.** 

A firebreak is a buffer zone of cleared land used to control the spread of wildfire and protect valuable assets. 
 
**Firebreak app helps you build a buffer around your finances, protecting yourself.**
