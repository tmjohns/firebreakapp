# Proposal 

## Introduction

The launch of Open Banking allows for a new approach to managing your personal finances. 

It is now possible to integrate all your banking data in one place, regardless of which bank you hold your account. Firebreak’s app can securely connect to the open banking API provided by your bank and download your account and transaction data. Our app then analyses and categorises these transactions, helping you to track and budget your spending across different categories. Our inbuilt tools will help you put your money to work for you, guiding you to achieving your financial goal. 

## Delivery

To ensure that we can deliver the best app for you, we will be going live with a public beta as soon as we can. Our initial requirement is to have data connectivity with the 4 major banks. This will be available in early 2021, according to the mandated timelines for Open Banking. Customers of these banks are invited to register for the public beta immediately. During the public beta we will be actively seeking customer feedback on the features and performance of the app.

To allow us to launch our public beta, we have chosen to leverage Frollo’s white label service to access the Open Banking API’s while we complete the due diligence process and gain our own accreditation. This will allow us to build out our app and deliver our MVP earlier. 

By gathering customer feedback, we will be able to iteratively improve the artificial intelligence technology and machine learning models that drive our analysis and classification engine based on anonymised data gathered during the beta. 

We will also focus on developing effective and appropriate visualisations to help you see and understand your financial position, set goals and achieve them.

Our accredited financial advice consultants are working with us to embed best practice money management techniques within our simple app workflow.

Customers of second-tier banks will need to wait until June/July for their providers to come online. We expect to exit public beta shortly after this, as this will mean enough providers are available for us to deliver the integrated experience our customers expect. Our pace of delivery will continue, as we mature our core product before focusing on the availability of our premium features. 

## Market Analysis

Increasingly, the primary channel for banking activity is via a mobile device. However, customers are still strongly tied to the app produced by their bank. For customers with multiple accounts at multiple banks, it can be very difficult to get a clear view of your whole position. Firebreak will change this. 

 
## Funding

We are a small team, developing Firebreak as a start-up venture.

•	The core of Firebreak will be available for free. 

We firmly believe it is important to build financial literacy across all levels of society and want everyone to be able to benefit from our application. 

We expect to have the following main sources of revenue.
* Users will be able to subscribe to a premium tier within the app. This will include additional features, and a subscription to curated financial news and content. This will be available ~6 months after our app launch
* Users will be able to ‘pay it forward’ and gift access to others who may benefit.
* In the medium term, we expect to receive referral fees from providers when our customers use our app to select to open an account from that provider. 
* In the long term, we will assess whether there is an opportunity to provide a white label API service of our own.

We intentionally choose not to pursue revenue streams that would commercialise the data of our consumers. While this closes door opportunity, we value privacy and are not prepared to compromise. This will be a source of competitive advantage for us, as consumers are increasingly aware of the privacy implications of the technology they consume.  

We are seeking investment and partnership as we look to accelerate the initial phase of our development. We will use initial funding to set up small teams and a sustainable operating rhythm to run an effective public beta. 

## Support Structure

We have a small team of people with the development expertise to build the prototype app, implement the artificial intelligence and machine learning for analysis and classification. We invite potential partners to help us realise our vision by providing funding, mentoring and leadership. 

We will need senior people to provide advice and oversight as we execute on our vision for Firebreak. In particular, we will need people with the legal expertise to navigate what we expect to be a complex accreditation process for access to the Open Banking APIs. 

With appropriate funding, we would scale the size of our development team to accelerate the iterative development of the app. With scale, we would expect to formalise these relationships and establish a corporate structure, board oversight and formal reporting lines, prior to the general release of the App.

We are also interested in developing a relationship with a reputable financial media outlet, where we can distribute financial news and content as a premium perk within our app.
