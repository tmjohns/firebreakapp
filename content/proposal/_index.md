# Proposal 

## Introduction

The launch of Open Banking allows for a new approach to managing your personal finances. 

It is now possible to integrate all your banking data in one place, regardless of which bank you hold your account. Firebreak’s app can securely connect to the open banking API provided by your bank and download your account and transaction data. Our app then analyses and categorises these transactions, helping you to track and budget your spending across different categories. Our inbuilt tools will help you put your money to work for you, guiding you to achieving your financial goal. 

## Delivery

To ensure that we can deliver the best app for you, we will be going live with a public beta as soon as we can. Our initial requirement is to have data connectivity with the 4 major banks. This will be available in early 2021, according to the mandated timelines for Open Banking. Customers of these banks are invited to register for the public beta immediately. During the public beta we will be actively seeking customer feedback on the features and performance of the app.

To allow us to launch our public beta, we have chosen to leverage Frollo’s white label service to access the Open Banking API’s while we complete the due diligence process and gain our own accreditation. This will allow us to build out our app and deliver our MVP earlier. 

By gathering customer feedback, we will be able to iteratively improve the artificial intelligence technology and machine learning models that drive our analysis and classification engine based on anonymised data gathered during the beta. 

We will also focus on developing effective and appropriate visualisations to help you see and understand your financial position, set goals and achieve them.

Our accredited financial advice consultants are working with us to embed best practice money management techniques within our simple app workflow. 

Customers of second-tier banks will need to wait until June/July for their providers to come online. We expect to exit public beta shortly after this, as this will mean enough providers are available for us to deliver the integrated experience our customers expect. Our pace of delivery will continue, as we mature our core product before focusing on the availability of our premium features. 

## Market Analysis

**"In 2019, over 64% of Australians used DIY options like mobile or internet banking."** (Roy Morgan, 2019). 

This represents at least 16 million potential customers for Firebreak, a number which we expect to continue to grow as customers and providers continue to evolve. 

With a very large (and continually growing) market for mobile banking, the launch of Open Banking presents a unique opportunity for disruption.

**"They are more than simply banking apps."**
**"Entire financial suite-of-micro apps delivered within one app, where people can manage all aspects of their financial lives."**
(Mozo, 2019)

Motivated consumers will pick and choose accounts, products, insurances and investments from a range of providers to develop an individual portfolio that perfectly suits their needs. In the current app landscape, this means that consumers must flick between the app from each provider, manually moving data between each one. Open banking enables a new, integrated approach.

**"delivery of individualised spending notifications, budget suggestions and saving nudges all driven by machine learning will separate the great from the good of banking apps."** (Mozo, 2019)

Firebreak is already hard at work producing a machine learning model to perform on device categorisation and analysis. By running this analysis on the device, we can ensure that neither Firebreak, or anyone else, needs access to the consumers data once they have it on their device. This keeps it private and secure. 

**"Via Open Banking, we should be moving to a world where a great banking app covers more than just money."** (Mozo, 2019)

Firebreak will launch energy and telecommunications providers in line with the Open Banking roadmap. We will also be exploring opportunities to integrate with other relvant industries to continously iterate and produce an app that allows both money and lifestyle management. 


## Funding

We are a small team, developing Firebreak as a start-up venture.

* **The core of Firebreak will be available for free.**

We firmly believe it is important to build financial literacy across all levels of society and want everyone to be able to benefit from our application. 

We expect to have the following main sources of revenue.
* Users will be able to subscribe to a premium tier within the app. This will include additional features, and a subscription to curated financial news and content. This will be available ~6 months after our app launch
* Users will be able to ‘pay it forward’ and gift access to others who may benefit.
* In the medium term, we expect to receive referral fees from providers when our customers use our app to select to open an account from that provider. 
* In the long term, we will assess whether there is an opportunity to provide a white label API service of our own.

We intentionally choose not to pursue revenue streams that would commercialise the data of our consumers. While this closes door opportunity, we value privacy and are not prepared to compromise. This will be a source of competitive advantage for us, as consumers are increasingly aware of the privacy implications of the technology they consume.  

We are seeking investment and partnership as we look to accelerate the initial phase of our development. We will use initial funding to set up small teams and a sustainable operating rhythm to run an effective public beta. 

## Support Structure

We have a small team of people with the development expertise to build the prototype app, implement the artificial intelligence and machine learning for analysis and classification. We invite potential partners to help us realise our vision by providing funding, mentoring and leadership. 

We will need senior people to provide advice and oversight as we execute on our vision for Firebreak. In particular, we will need people with the legal expertise to navigate what we expect to be a complex accreditation process for access to the Open Banking APIs. 

With appropriate funding, we would scale the size of our development team to accelerate the iterative development of the app. With scale, we would expect to formalise these relationships and establish a corporate structure, board oversight and formal reporting lines, prior to the general release of the App.

We are also interested in developing a relationship with a reputable financial media outlet, where we can distribute financial news and content as a premium perk within our app. 

## Conclusion

The imminent launch of Open Banking access to account and transaction data held by the big 4 banks presents a unique opportunity to iteratively develop an integrated money management app. Advances in smartphone technology and in artificial intelligence / machine learning mean that it is now possible to run the analysis that supports Firebreak App in a secure way on a consumers own device. The pieces are aligned. 

The team at Firebreak are ready to capitalize on this opportunity.
