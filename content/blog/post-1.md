Firebreak is a new personal finance app. 

Enabled by Open Banking, we allow you to manage your finances, on your device, with control over your data. 


## Introduction

Over the last 15 years, rapid advances in technology has meant that smartphones are nearly ubiquitious. Mobile banking has become the predominant way for consumers to do their banking. 

Many jurisdictions across the world have introduced regulations that see banks (and other providers) open up access to their data. In Australia, this is known as Open Banking, phase 1 of the Consumer Data Right (Treasury, 2018). This has intentionally created an opportunity for innovation to occur. Governments have invested in these open data initiatives to stimulate economic growth across technology, industry and finance. (Gozman et al. 2018)

Firebreak App brings these two together to provide Australian consumers with a single app for managing their personal finances. Within the app, consumers will be able to view and analyse all their data. 

## Context

A key axiom of the consumer data right is that it 'should be implemented with security and privacy in mind' (Treasury, 2018). This is an important technological consideration. API's like Open Banking facilitate access, but also pose key security challenges to protect the security and integrity of the data (Mansfield Devine, 2016). Firebreak App will be built with security in mind. The guidelines for accreditation as a recipient of data specify the stringent security standards we need to meet (ACCC, 2020). 

Firebreak App will also takes advantage of developments in Artifical Intelligence. We will develop a transaction classification model that can analyse transaction data, and group them into categories based on the attributes of the transaction. This takes the hard work out of budgeting. Advances in technology mean that we can now build and train this model on anonymized data, and deploy it with our app. When your device recieves your data, our model can classify your transactions, but your data does not need to come to us. Your privacy will be protected. 

## Stakeholder Benefits

### Consumers

Today, a consumer must have the mobile app from each provider in order to see the information. Under the Consumer Data Right, they will be able to have one app that can connect to multiple providers, and pull the data into a format that suits them. Firebreak App offers a platform for consumers to do that. 

In additon to managing their information, our users will be able to view and compare product offers across providers. They will be able to make informed decisions about which banking products are right for them. 

Although promoted as a Consumer Data Right, some research has shown that many consumers are indifferent about Open Banking as a concept. (Dratva, 2020; 65). Firebreak App offers a practical demonstration of the value Open Banking can add for the consumer. 

### Providers

Providers gain an additional channel to attract new business. The Consumer Data Right includes new API's to provide product information and offers. By providing quality products, targeted at consumers who understand their needs, they can attract and retain customers. With appropriate consents, the Open Banking data can be exchanged to support applications and make better credit decisions. 

Providers will be challenged to remain relevant. As more consumers use apps like Firebreak, they will need to manage the risk of disintermediation. If users don't have to use the banks own app, they may lose the connection to the consumer. (Guibaud, 2015: 8)

## Conclusion

Firebreak App will take advantage of the opportunity presented by Open Banking and represents the next evolution of mobile banking. It meets consumer demands for easy and efficent ways to manage finances and will show consumers why the consumer data right is important to them. Our focus on security and privacy will set us apart from other platforms who seek to profit from data.
